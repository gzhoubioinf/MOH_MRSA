# MOH_MRSA Data Repository

This repository contains data and analysis related to MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) studies conducted by KAUST IDE lab. Below is a description of the key directories:

## Directory Structure

- **GWAS**: This folder contains data and results from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) focused on identifying genetic determinants associated with drug resistance and virulence in MRSA strains.

- **metadata**: The metadata file contains genetic, demographic, and phenotypic details for MRSA samples. It includes unique identifiers and comprehensive sequencing information alongside geographic data from the collection sites. 

- **panaroo**: Contains outputs from the Panaroo pipeline, which is used for pangenome analysis, providing insights into the genetic diversity and evolutionary relationships among MRSA strains.

- **srst2_resistence**: Results from the SRST2 tool for resistance gene detection. This folder includes antibiotic resistance gene profiling data.

- **srst2_vf**: This directory includes results from using SRST2 to identify virulence factors in MRSA strains, aiding in the understanding of pathogenicity and infection mechanisms.
