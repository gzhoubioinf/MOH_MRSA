# Scripts Directory

This directory contains several scripts used in the analysis of MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) data within the MOH_MRSA project. Below is a description of each script and its purpose.

## Contents

- **README.md**
  - This file provides an overview of all scripts in this directory.

- **run_panaroo.sh**
  - This script executes the Panaroo pipeline, a tool for pangenome analysis, which is essential for understanding the genetic relationships and diversity within MRSA strains.

- **run_scoary.sh**
  - Runs Scoary, which is used for the discovery of statistically significant associations between gene presence and phenotype in bacterial datasets.

- **tmp_resistance.sh**
  - A utility script designed to analyze antibiotic resistance by processing data through the SRST2 (Short Read Sequence Typing for Bacterial Pathogens) tool, providing insights into the resistance profiles of the sampled MRSA strains.

- **tmp_vg.sh**
  - Handles the processing of virulence gene data, assisting in the identification and categorization of virulence factors within the MRSA genomes.
